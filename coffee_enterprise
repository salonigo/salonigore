    "# Section 1: Dataset\n",
    "Coffee plays an important role in my daily life. To me drinking coffee is an entire experience, right from planning which coffee drink I’ll be making, the ingredients, the process of making it to actually drinking it. But one thing that stands out to me in terms of coffee is its aroma, which I value greatly. Its smell is sharp and brings a sudden burst of freshness. I associate it with good memories from times I have spent with my friends in coffee shops. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have always dreamed of opening my own coffee shop and to do so I want to understand which coffee beans offer the best aromatic profile. Aroma is an important evaluation criterion as it significantly influences consumer perception and enjoyment. At the same time, sustainability is equally important to me. I have identified that one way I can be cautious about my shop’s environmental impact is by getting my beans from ethically sourced and processed producers. Coffee processing can be water-intensive and environmentally demanding, so finding high-quality beans that are produced responsibly is important to my research.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset I am using contains various coffee bean characteristics and their respective quality metrics. Each row is a type of coffee, the number of bags available for it, the weight of the bags, the processing method of the beans, aroma etc. I found this dataset on Kaggle under the ‘Coffee Bean Quality Dataset’ where I downloaded it as a csv. This dataset caught my attention because it two things I care about — quality and sustainability — to identify which coffees not only smell and taste great but are also processed in ways that align with my environmental values."

To do this I chose to focus on the minimum and first quartile which will give me the smaller bags which are more sustainable. The median and mean of the 'Number of Bags' variable will give me the average bags produced overall, which gives an understanding of the production intensity. The median will tell me the typical production quantity. \n",

    "What I learnt from my current analysis is that small-batch coffees can achieve very high aroma scores. This shows that sustainability and quality are not mutually exclusive. I also observed that the Natural / Dry processing method dominates among these sustainable coffees. Beans like Gesha, Typica, and SL28 are the ideal ones in terms of aroma and overall scores. Also the number of bags of beans does not to compromise quality like for eg beans with only 1–5 bags are actually ranking at the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going forward I want to investigate the relationship between the quality and production scale to determine whether smaller, sustainable batches consistently deliver higher sensory scores. I might add more varibles as well if there is not enough to analyse. I might also look at how the processing method could maybe impact the bean quality by looking at the charcteristics of each bean. And then I might end with examining the patterns across multiple sensory metrics to identify coffees that excel in overall quality. I am not sure which approach I will take.\n"

    "I chose this question for my data analysis because I have clear numerical variables: aroma and number of bags, which I have already explored so it's an easy continuation. Also in my project so far, I have explored the aroma score and production scale as separate variables, but to be a sustainable coffee shop owner, I need to understand if the high scoring aroma beans come from the small batch bags. This question will help me understand that if smaller number of bags show higher aroma scores, then sourcing low-volume beans will allow me to maintain the quality and reducing environmental impact."

So by using a sample data I can test a claim that I make and whether the differences in aroma scores across the production scales and whether they are meaningful or just due to random variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now for the hypothesis test I will split my filtered dataset from the end of Section 3 at the median number of bags. This will splits my sample into two equal-sized groups and compare them. Group 1 represent the low-production beans and Group 2 are the high-production beans. \n",
    "\n",
    "So my hypotheses are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "H₀ (Null): There is no difference in aroma score between low-production and high-production beans.\n",
    "\n",
    "H₁ (Alternative): The low-production beans have a higher mean aroma score than high-production beans."

    "The median for the low-production beans is higher than for high-production beans. This can help support my case that the smaller batches might have a slightly higher aroma score. Both the plots have a similar IQR, suggesting that each production scale is comparable. The whiskers of the low-production group has a  wider range, indicating that they might have more variation in aroma score. There is an outlier in the high-production box which suggests that while most of the high-production beans cluster around the median, there are some high-scoring beans even in large batches.\n",

    "So while the above plot allowed me to compare the medians between the two groups, I wanted to create an additional histogram plot to see whether one production group consistently clusters at higher aroma scores. The histogram hopefully will reveal if most beans fall into high-aroma or low-aroma categories. It will show if one group had most of its values in the high range. This will help answer how the aroma values are distributed in the production groups."

I can see that for the low production group has an aroma score of 8.07-8.15 and 8.17–8.25. For high production group has an aroma score of 8.07-8.11 and 8.15–8.17 and one outlier around 8.30. The low production group is a bit more consistent around the middle range of 8.07-8.15, but the high production group has more variation in the spread of the data. The variation might be because some beans in the group might have higher aroma scores. "

    "# Section 7: Overall Summary\n",
    "In this project, I analyzed a dataset of 1,329 coffee beans. My goal was to identify coffee beans for my coffee shop that had a high aroma score and were processed sustainabily. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this I focused on the aroma score, processing method, and production scale. The average aroma score across the dataset was 7.7358. I used this score(7.7358) as a threshold to find the coffee beans that have a higher aroma score than the mean. I found that 706 beans exceeded this threshold, making them strong choices for high-quality, aromatic coffees. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the sustainability criteria, I looked at the ‘processing methods’ and ‘number of bags’ of coffee beans variables. According to multiple online resources the coffee processing methods has significant environmental implications. The coffee processing methods mainly depends on water usage. This dataset had multiple processing methods like washed and wet and etc. They all have distinct sustainability profiles. \n",
    "When the dataset was filtered according to the highest aroma scores, I observed that Washed / Wet, Natural / Dry and Pulped Natural / Honey were the most common approaches. Out of these Washed / Wet is the most water-intensive but Natural / Dry and Pulped Natural / Honey are the most sustainable methods and featured strongly in my filtered high-aroma subset. \n",
    "\n",
    "The number of bags was an important variable as beans with fewer bags are more sustainable due to smaller production scale. The production scale varied widely and the median number of bags is 74 and the mean is 185.22. This descriptive statistics indicated that some beans are produced in large number of bag quantities. Focusing on the small-batched bags is more aligned with environmentally conscious sourcing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The line plot of number of bags vs. aroma scores showed that many of the smallest batches of bags had the highest aroma scores. This suggests that small-scale production does not compromise quality. The second plot shows that the distribution of small-batch beans had batches of 1–10 bags, again reinforcing the availability of sustainable options. In terms of the beans variety, the visualization revealed that beans such as Gesha and Typica consistently had aroma scores between 8.08 and 8.58, making them the most suited, top aromatic and sustainably processed coffees.\n",
    "\n",
    "When testing my hypothesis about if low-production beans have higher aroma scores than high-production beans, the statistical results show that t-statistic = −0.357 and p = 0.633 suggest no significant difference. On the other hand the boxplots showing that low-production beans had a slightly higher median aroma score. Thus overall my analysis demonstrates that both sustainability and quality can coexist in coffee sourcing. \n",
    "Based on all of my results, I would choose the following beans for my coffee shop:Gesha, Typica, and SL28. These are the small-batches of beans that are sustainably processed through Natural / Dry or Pulped Natural / Honey methods. They also have an average aroma score of 8.08 and 8.58 which is above the 7.74 mean score threshold. Even though my hypothesis test showed no statistically significant difference between low- and high-production aroma scores, my visualizations and descriptive data suggest that the small-batch beans can deliver top-tier aroma without large environmental impact. \n"
